# Insight-challenge

My solution to the Coding challenge is in: Codes
Inside you could find:
wc_input    #I have input 3 text files for testng
wc_output
count.py    #This code is for counting words
median.py   #This code is for getting the medians
run.sh
#There are other text files producing during the code running 

The Maze project has 3 main files:
main.cpp
Maze.cpp
Maze.h
the other 3 input .txt files

In this project,I have explored both breadth first search and depth first search via stack and queue.It was not the most difficult one but it always reminds me of coding things effectively.
