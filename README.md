#My solution to the Coding challenge is in: Codes
Inside you could find:
* "wc_input"    -I have input 3 text files for testng
* "wc_output"
* "count.py"   -This code is for counting words
* "median.py"   -This code is for getting the medians
* "run.sh"      -The bash script
* other text files producing during the code running 
To run it, you could just type ./run.sh in Gygwin
#The Maze project has 3 main files:
* "main.cpp"
* "Maze.cpp"
* "Maze.h"
* the other 3 input .txt files
In this project,I have explored both breadth first search and depth first search via stack and queue.It is not the most difficult one but it is an inspiring one.
